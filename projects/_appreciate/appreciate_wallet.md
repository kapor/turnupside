App/Service based on the idea of putting aftermarket value on items that you buy – focusing on quality over quantity. Doing this would initially involve having a “digital twin” (NFT counterpart) of every luxury item a customer buys. This digital twin would contain all the data and history of the item and would somehow be transferred and authenticated if the tangible item ever changed hands. Partnerships with brands – as well as customer-created entries would eventually formulate a database called “The Catalog of Everything”.
